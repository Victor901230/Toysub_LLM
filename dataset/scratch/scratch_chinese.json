Instead, it's better to rephrase the sentence to make it clear that these toys provide repeated learning opportunities.\n5. \"long-lasting and focused educational toys with repeated games\" should be \"long-lasting and focused educational toys that offer repeated play.\" The phrase \"with repeated games\" is redundant, as \"repeated play\" already implies multiple games.\n6. \"There are also more and more different toys of this type depending on the age of infants and young children\" should be \"As for the age groups, there is an increasing variety of such toys suitable for infants and young children.\" The original sentence was a bit confusing, as it seemed to imply that the number of toys increases with the age of the child, which might not always be the case. Instead, I've rephrased the sentence to make it clear that there is an increasing variety of toys available for different age groups."

At 10:05 AM, NHK Radio is broadcast as \"NHK Radio!\" featuring news and topics of interest to children.\"\n\nIn this revised version, I've made the following changes:\n\n1. Corrected the grammar by using \"Today's coverage on NHK Radio\" instead of \"Media coverage of NHKRadio.\" This makes the sentence clearer and more concise.\n2. Clarified that the presentation being discussed is for October 11, 2018, to avoid any confusion about the date.\n3. Simplified the phrase \"Newscasts show ToYSUB child interest!\" by rephrasing it as \"featuring news and topics of interest to children.\" This makes the sentence more understandable to English speakers who may not be familiar with the term \"ToYSUB.\""

The return date for STEP03 and the subsequent toy shipment will be adjusted according to the child's age.\n\nExplanation:\n- In the first sentence, \"exclude\" is more appropriate than \"does not include.\"\n- In the second sentence, I changed \"return of\" to \"return date for\" for clarity, and added \"and the subsequent toy shipment\" to make it clear that both events are being adjusted. Additionally, \"will be adjusted\" was replaced with \"will be adjusted according to,\" as this more clearly indicates the reason for the adjustment. Finally, I changed \"the child's age\" to lowercase to follow standard English grammar rules."
