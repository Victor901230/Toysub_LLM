Infants and young children can usually lift their heads at 2 months, roll over at 4 months, and sit steadily at 6 months.

In addition, properly guiding your baby to grasp, shake, knock or press toys with his hands can strengthen his sensory integration and motor development. Matching toys with bright colors, rich materials, sound and light effects, or reactions can also further stimulate the baby's motivation to explore.
