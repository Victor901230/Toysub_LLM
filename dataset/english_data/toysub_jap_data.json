        "translated_text": "Selecting puzzles appropriate for the child’s growth is essential.When children reach around 1 to 1.5 years old and begin to move their hands and feet more actively, it may be a good time to introduce puzzles.Since there are individual differences in development and varying difficulty levels among puzzles, choosing puzzles according to both age and developmental stage is important.For children aged 1 to 2, simple educational puzzles are recommended.Shape-sorting puzzles involve matching star, circle, triangle, and other shapes into corresponding holes, helping with recognition and cognitive development.Pickup puzzles, where children place animal or food-shaped pieces with knobs into a board, are good for hand movement practice and learning vocabulary.Children at this age may also enjoy 1 to 9-piece jigsaw puzzles.Choose puzzles with clear, colorful shapes and a size that avoids choking hazards.Recommended puzzles for this age include animal-themed pickup puzzles, which can also be used for tracing shapes and coloring.For children aged 2 to 4, puzzles that support understanding of language, numbers, and shapes are suitable.These include puzzles with hiragana, numbers, or English letters, as well as tangrams and cube puzzles that double as building blocks.Board puzzles, similar to jigsaw puzzles, also become enjoyable at this stage.An example is a train-themed hiragana matching puzzle, where children match pieces with images and characters to the board and gradually expand their learning.For children aged 4 to 6, more complex puzzles that promote higher thinking skills and knowledge acquisition are effective.Route puzzles involve connecting pieces with grooves to guide a ball to the goal, fostering imagination and logical thinking.Puzzle-style board games challenge children to solve tasks using given pieces and sometimes incorporate familiar story themes to encourage creativity.Trying 50-piece or more jigsaw puzzles with intricate designs or educational themes like Japanese syllabary or maps is also recommended.Three-dimensional puzzles and map puzzles shaped like Japanese prefectures can satisfy children's intellectual curiosity.One recommended puzzle is the Little Red Riding Hood puzzle by SMRT GAMES, where children help her reach her grandmother's house by creating a path on the board.The difficulty varies depending on whether a wolf is included.To effectively support a child's development using puzzles, consider the following points.Do not force puzzle play if the child is uninterested or unable to focus.Respect their autonomy and enjoy the completed puzzles together.Even partial progress should be praised.As children's interests and preferences evolve, select puzzles that match their growth stage and engagement level.Subscription-based educational toy rental services can provide puzzles suited to the child’s current stage, helping parents discover suitable options.For those unsure about which puzzle to choose, using a rental service is a good idea.In summary, educational puzzles can help develop concentration, observation, memory, and other cognitive skills.Since there are many types of puzzles, it is important to select ones that suit the child's age and developmental stage.",

    {
        "translated_text": "The main reasons early English education is important include the fact that foreign language classes are now part of the elementary school curriculum and having a TOEIC or similar score can be advantageous for future education or employment.Starting English early increases the chances of scoring well on tests like TOEIC or Eiken, which can help with university admissions and job opportunities.The benefits of early English learning include increased exposure time, reduced resistance to learning, and the development of an English ear and brain, which support better comprehension and fluency.However, when teaching English to young children, it is important to keep the learning fun, use various tools like songs and games, and create positive memories through praise and engagement.The ideal age to start English education is said to be around 3 to 7 years old due to rapid auditory development.Even from 1 to 3 years old, exposure to English pronunciation is beneficial.For ages 0 to 2, it is effective to use sound-based methods such as toys with English audio, CDs, movies, or music in English.At this age, the goal should be to casually incorporate English into daily life rather than teaching vocabulary or grammar directly.Care should be taken not to confuse children by mixing Japanese and English simultaneously, which may delay language development.For ages 2 to 4, it is important to introduce enjoyable activities that create a positive image of English, such as singing songs, dancing, reading English picture books, and playing music during meals or playtime.From age 5, as Japanese becomes more established as a first language, children can begin to learn English more systematically.However, learning should still be fun to avoid developing negative feelings.Recommended methods include performing English activities, singing, playing games, listening to English via CDs or apps, reading books together, and incorporating occasional English in family conversations.Interacting with native speakers also helps improve communication and cultural understanding.To make English learning enjoyable at home, it is essential to create an engaging environment where the child feels that English is fun.Children are more likely to enjoy learning when they see adults having fun too.Four suggested ways for home learning include reading picture books that connect words and images, watching English videos or animations without forcing the child, using online English lessons that fit the child’s personality, and playing with educational toys that support both learning and creativity.Articles featuring age-specific English learning toys recommended by Toysub planners are also available for further reference.In summary, early English education should be enjoyable to prevent resistance.",
